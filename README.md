# Java Pong Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Pong game in Java. The game includes two paddles and a ball. Players use the W/S keys and Up/Down arrow keys to control the paddles. The game keeps track of the score, and the ball resets to the center of the screen when a point is scored.

## Setup and Requirements

The application requires:

- Java SE Development Kit 8 or later

You can download the latest version of JDK from Oracle's official website. After installing the JDK, you can run the game from the command line:

\```bash
javac PongGame.java
java PongGame
\```

## Gameplay

- Player 1 uses the W/S keys to move the paddle up and down.
- Player 2 uses the Up/Down arrow keys to move the paddle up and down.
- A point is scored when the ball hits the left or right edge of the screen.
- The ball's direction is reversed when it hits a paddle or the top/bottom edge of the screen.
